## How It Works

### Legitimacy Scoring System

The tool uses a weighted scoring system:

- **Domain Age (40%)**: Domains older than 3 years are considered more trustworthy
- **Contact Information (30%)**: Presence of verifiable contact details
- **Social Media Presence (20%)**: Active social media links and profiles
- **SEO Presence (10%)**: Search engine visibility and optimization

### Analysis Categories

- **LIKELY LEGITIMATE (70-100 points)**: Well-established websites with good indicators
- **SUSPICIOUS - NEEDS REVIEW (40-69 points)**: Mixed signals requiring manual verification
- **LIKELY FAKE/SUSPICIOUS (0-39 points)**: Multiple red flags detected

## Development

To run in development mode with auto-restart:

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
npm run dev
```

## Security Features
